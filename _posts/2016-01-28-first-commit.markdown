As cliche as the ubiquitious first post is, it's also a fun reminder to disconnect yourself from obligations or mental hangups.

As part of beginning the second instructional module at [Turing School](http://turing.io) I was to learn (refresh) my knowledge of HTML and CSS and create a blog to contribute technical posts to during the course of the year. It was recommended we try Jekyll, described as a "blog-aware" static page tool. I had utterly forgotten that my husband Mark began using Jekyll years ago, while I was fumbling with WordPress themes.

The calendar at Turing is so crowded, and my workflow currently so centered around a text editor and git, that it was frankly refreshing to admit that I just wanted to try something different.

I'm using Jekyll through the Ruby gem. [Take a look.](http://jekyllrb.com/) Eventually I might move it over to my husband's VPN, but again, simplicity is sometimes nice!

My personal blog is still online, though quiet, at [tryptophantastic.com](http://tryptophantastic.com).

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_greeting(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end
print_greeting('World')
#=> prints 'Hello, World' to STDOUT.
